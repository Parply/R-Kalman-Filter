# R Kalman Filter

R kalman filter functions

## Filters

*KF - Kalman filter for linear gaussian distributed state space models
*EKF - Extended Kalman filter for non-linear differentiable gaussian distributed state space models. (Use's linearisation) 
*UKf - Unscented Kalman filter for non-linear differentiable gaussian distributed state space models. (Use's sigma points)
